# ESP32-FT857-CAT
The library implements via a serial link the FT-857D CAT (Computer Aided Transceiver) controls and additional readings of the transceiverâ€™s EEPROM. 
The library is strictly identical to the one used in the FT857-Web-browser-CAT-ESP32 repository; it was duplicated to facilitate a reuse. Refer to that repository if you wish an example of application.
The developments were made from a source code developed for Arduino by VE3BUX then enhanced and ported on ESP32. See my web site for more details (https://f6czv.fr) 73 Philippe F6CZV
